This repository contains parts of the simulation and code behind different agents for the project Theory of Mind in Mixed Strategic Game (2018-2021).
In this project, [Atiye](https://governance.ut.ac.ir/en/dr-atiye-sarabi-jamab) and I wanted to know how higher levels of Theory of Mind (ToM) relate to prosocial behavior.
The simulated agents were built using model-free on top of Q-learning.
